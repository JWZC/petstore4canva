# Canva Technical Writer Challenge #1

Thank you for taking the time to review my challenge. It was a lot of fun. You will find the markdown file containing the assignment [here](petstore_tutorial.md).

## Key decisions and thought process
### Content
This was an interesting challenge. The most difficult part was providing the correct level of detail for the audience. The instructions state that the audience is familiar with APIs, HTML and JS, but not familiar with the Petstore API. Therefore, I focused on providing contextual information about the API and general information about its usage, without going into too much technical detail, as the assumption is that a developer familiar with APIs should have no difficulty with this relatively straightforward API. Wherever possible, I linked out to relevant information instead of repeating it in the tutorial for the sake of concision. 

I introduced the API endpoints with a brief description of each and chose to simply link to the source documentation instead of repeating their details in my tutorial.

Moreover, I focused on just one method, findByStatus, as it's the only one relevant for the tutorial. I did not comment the JSON Pet object because I felt the fields were straightforward and self-explanatory enough.

The testing instructions were likewise brief, as I can assume that a developer who knows APIs should be able to easily test one, but for the sake of completeness of the tutorial, I added just a few words on running a test. I did include an annotated screenshot here, as I am a big fan of using visual aids in my documentation when appropriate.

For the web page, I aimed to provide exactly the necessary amount of information without any unnecessary detail. Instead of reposting my entire Codepen solution, I chose to link to it, and only included the most necessary HTML and JS in the code snippets. I suggested that the reader can add whatever additional code they wish. I decided to comment the JS code snippet here as it's possible the reader may not be familiar with the ``fetch()`` method so I thought that documenting the code itself would be prudent.

Lastly, I concluded the tutorial with a few links to relevant resources. I always conclude documentation with links to other resources. I believe that an article should never conclude with a 'dead end'. It's always better to give your reader additional resources and links to follow instead of just abruptly ending.

### Style and tone

This challenge showcases my personal writing style, which I sum up with three C's: clarity, concision, compassion. As I mentioned above, I always endeavour to write in the most clear and straightforward manner possible, avoiding overly technical terminology or ornate vocabulary whenever necessary. I aim to communicate the absolute necessary information in the fewest words possible. Finally, I always consider the needs of my audience. In this case, that meant thinking a lot about what my reader likely is and is not familiar with and tailoring the level of complexity in the instructions appropriately.

You'll notice that I employ a friendly and approachable tone in my tutorial. I firmly believe that, when appropriate, a light, friendly and conversational tone is always the best choice. Writing this way will put your reader at ease, and they might even enjoy themselves or have a chuckle. What's wrong with having a bit of fun? I use personal pronouns and informal language and punctuation to give a friendly and relaxed feel. Though of course this tone isn't appropriate for all settings, I felt it was suitable for a simple web tutorial.

## Final thoughts

I enjoyed working on this challenge and I hope it shows in the end result. I really do love creating good help documentation and how-to guides, as they just make life easier for everyone. Thank you for taking the time to review my challenge :)
